# Ovatemp iOS App

## Installation

### Clone the repo

  cd ovatemp_ios

### Install Cocoapods (if you haven't already)

  gem install cocoapods

### Open the project

There's a shortcut executable in the root project directory you can use to make sure you always open the correct workspace (this will also install Cocoapods for the first time, if need be).
